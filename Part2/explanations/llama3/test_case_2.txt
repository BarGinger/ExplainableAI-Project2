So, I'm trying to get my coffee fix, and my goal is to have some delicious brew. To start with, I believe that I already have a card of my own, which should come in handy later on.

As I think about how to achieve my goal, I realize that getting coffee is the first step towards having it. So, I decide to go for the 'getCoffee' action. It's just the most straightforward way to get started, you know?

Now, as I'm considering my options for getting kitchen coffee specifically, I recall that I already have a staff card available. That makes things a lot easier! In fact, it's so easy that I don't need to think about any other options - 'getKitchenCoffee' is the way to go.

Of course, there were some other paths I could've taken. For instance, I could've tried to get an office coffee or even shopped for one. But honestly, those just seemed like a lot more hassle than necessary. And besides, with my staff card available, why bother?

In any case, once I got the kitchen coffee, it was time to wrap things up. Since all my preconditions were met, 'getOwnCard' was an easy choice. After that, I could just enjoy my coffee and consider my decision-making process a success!
