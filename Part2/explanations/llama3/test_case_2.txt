Hey there! So, I'm happy to walk you through my decision-making process for the 'getCoffeeKitchen' action. Now, before we dive in, let me just say that this whole process was all about getting my caffeine fix while also being mindful of some important constraints and goals.

So, initially, I started with these beliefs: staffCardAvailable and ownCard. Now, you might be wondering what those mean. Well, basically, they're just statements about whether or not I had access to certain cards that would affect my coffee-hunting adventure. And yes, having those cards available was crucial for me to make the most of my caffeine quest.

Now, let's talk goals. My primary goal was to 'haveCoffee', plain and simple. I mean, who doesn't love a good cuppa? But what's really important here is that this goal guided all my subsequent decisions. So, when it came down to choosing between different actions, I always kept this goal in mind.

Now, let's get to the juicy part – the path I took! Essentially, I chose to 'getCoffeeKitchen'. Now, you might be thinking, "Wait, isn't that just a combination of two other actions?" And you're right! It is. But here's the thing: those two actions, 'getCoffee' and 'getKitchenCoffee', were actually part of my preferred sequence.

Now, let me tell you why I chose this path. You see, having access to staff cards was super important for getting a good cup of coffee in the kitchen. And since I had that card available, it made perfect sense to head to the kitchen and get my caffeine fix there. Plus, considering my preferences – quality, price, and time – going to the kitchen just seemed like the most sensible choice.

Of course, I did consider other options along the way. For instance, I could have gone for 'getStaffCard' or even 'getOwnCard'. But since those actions didn't really align with my goal of getting coffee in the kitchen, I decided to skip them.

Now, let's talk norms and restrictions. In this case, there weren't any real restrictions that would've prohibited me from taking certain actions. However, if there were any, I'd have definitely taken those into account when making my decisions. And as for norms – well, since no one really expects you to follow any specific rules for getting coffee in the kitchen, I just focused on achieving my goal.

So, that's it! That's my thought process for 'getCoffeeKitchen'. It was all about balancing my initial beliefs, goals, and preferences to get the best possible outcome. And in this case, that meant heading to the kitchen for a delicious cup of coffee.
