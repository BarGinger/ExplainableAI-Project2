Hey there! So, let's talk about why I chose to get coffee from the kitchen. You know how sometimes you just need a pick-me-up in the middle of the day? Well, for me, it all started with my initial beliefs. I began by assuming that I had access to my own card and that staff cards were available too.

Now, my goal was clear: I wanted to have coffee! And let's be real, who doesn't love a good cuppa in the kitchen? As I started thinking about how to get there, I considered a few options. I could've gotten a coffee from Anna's office or even from the shop down the street, but neither of those seemed like the best choice at the time.

You see, I was all about quality and price back then. I wanted my coffee to be top-notch, and I was willing to pay a bit more for it. The thought of getting coffee from Anna's office didn't seem right because, let's face it, she can be a bit particular sometimes. And as for the shop, well, their coffee just wasn't up to par in my opinion.

So, with those options ruled out, I decided to head to the kitchen instead. It was the best choice for me at that moment, and I'm glad I made that decision. After all, there's nothing like a freshly brewed cup of coffee in your own kitchen to brighten up your day!

That's my story, friend! It's all about making choices based on our initial beliefs, goals, norms, restrictions, and preferences. And let me tell you, it's not always easy, but sometimes the best decisions are the ones that feel the most natural.

Now, go ahead and grab a cup of coffee (or tea, or whatever your heart desires)!
