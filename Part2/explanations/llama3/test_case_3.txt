Here's my attempt at rewriting your naive explanation in a natural, first-person account:

As I set out to achieve my goal of having coffee, I started with the assumption that I have the necessary money and Ann is in her office. My top priority is to get high-quality coffee, followed by affordability and speed.

When I considered getting coffee from the kitchen, I realized it wasn't a viable option because I didn't have access to the staff card required for that action. So, I moved on to think about other ways to get my hands on some coffee.

I weighed the pros and cons of visiting Ann's office versus going to the shop. Although getting coffee from Ann's office would be cheaper and faster than going to the shop, it wasn't as high-quality an option. The decisive factor for me was the quality of the coffee, which is why I chose to go to the shop instead.

Luckily, I had the necessary money to pay for my coffee at the shop, so that wasn't a concern. Once I got my coffee, I knew that's all there was to it â€“ I'd achieved my goal of having coffee!

I hope this sounds like me explaining my thought process to someone!
