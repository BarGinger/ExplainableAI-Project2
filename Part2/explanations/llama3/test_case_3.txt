So, I was trying to figure out how to get some coffee. To start with, I had the basic belief that I had enough money to cover the cost of getting a cup. And, for some reason, I thought Ann would be in the office - not that it really mattered for this particular task.

My main goal was to just have some coffee, plain and simple. As for my preferences, I ranked them like this: quality is most important, followed by price, and then time. I know, I know, it sounds a bit weird, but hey, priorities are what they are!

Now, I considered a few options to get that coffee. First off, I thought about heading to the kitchen - you know, the usual spot for a quick brew. But, unfortunately, I didn't have my staff card handy, which is a pre requisite for that particular route.

That ruled out the kitchen option, so I started looking elsewhere. That's when I landed on getting coffee from the shop. Now, at first glance, it might seem like a more expensive and time-consuming option compared to Ann's office, where she keeps her own coffee stash. However, what really tipped the scales for me was the quality - or rather, the lack thereof. I mean, have you tried Ann's coffee? It's...interesting.

So, getting coffee from the shop it was! And let me tell you, it was a great choice. Not only did I get a decent cup of joe, but I also managed to pay for it without breaking the bank or wasting too much time. And, as an added bonus, I got that coveted coffee fix.

Looking back, I'm glad I made that decision. It's funny how sometimes things just work out - in this case, getting coffee from the shop was the perfect solution.
