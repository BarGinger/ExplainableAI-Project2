Here's my attempt at rewriting your naive explanation into a natural, first-person account:

So, when it comes to getting coffee, I had a few things on my mind. First, I knew I had the money to spend, and Ann was in her office, which didn't really impact my decision-making process. My main goal was to get some coffee, and I prioritized three things: quality, price, and time.

As I started considering options, I realized that getting coffee from the kitchen wasn't possible because I didn't have the necessary staff card available. So, that option was out of the question.

Next, I thought about visiting Ann's office to see if she had any coffee there. But then I remembered that I wanted to prioritize quality, price, and time, and Ann's office wasn't exactly known for its high-quality brews or reasonable prices. Plus, it would take me some extra time to get there, so it didn't seem like the best option.

That's when I turned my attention to the coffee shop. Now, that place had a reputation for serving decent coffee at a reasonable price, and it was relatively quick too. When I compared the options in my mind, the coffee shop seemed like the clear winner. Not only did they offer good quality at an affordable price, but it would also take me less time to get there than if I went to Ann's office.

Of course, before I could grab my coffee, I needed to make sure I had the money for it. Thankfully, I did, so paying was no issue. And once I'd paid and picked up my coffee, I felt like I'd successfully achieved my goal of getting some coffee â€“ and it was all thanks to choosing the right option!

I hope that sounds natural and clear! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.
