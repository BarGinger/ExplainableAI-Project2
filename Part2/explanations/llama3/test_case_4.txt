So, I ended up choosing the "payShop" action in the end. But before we get there, let me walk you through my thought process.

I was trying to achieve the goal of having a cup of coffee, right? So, I started by considering what options were available to me. I had my own card and staff cards available, which made things easier. And, as it turned out, one of my colleagues was around too - that was a nice bonus!

Now, when it comes to getting my coffee fix, quality is super important to me. I mean, I'm a bit of a coffee snob! But, let's be real, price and time were also crucial factors in my decision-making process. If I had to prioritize one, though, I'd say quality takes the cake.

As I was weighing these options, I noticed that Ann was in her office, which made things more convenient for me. I mean, who doesn't love grabbing a coffee with their colleague? But, I digress! The norm or restriction here was that I couldn't just pop into her office - it had to be done in a specific way.

So, after considering all these factors, I decided to follow the path of getting my own coffee from the shop. It wasn't the most straightforward route, but it seemed like the best option given my initial beliefs and preferences. And, as it turns out, that's exactly what happened!

In the end, I chose to "payShop", which took me down a specific sequence of actions: get Coffee, get Shop Coffee, go to Shop, pay Shop, and finally get Coffee from the Shop. It was a bit of a journey, but in the end, it led me to my desired outcome - a delicious cup of coffee!
