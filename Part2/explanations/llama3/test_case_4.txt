Here's my attempt at rewriting your naive explanation in a natural, first-person account:

So, let me tell you about the decision I made regarding 'payShop'. First things first, there were some beliefs and goals that influenced my thinking. For instance, I believed that my staff card was available, I had my own card, my colleague was available too, and I had enough money to spare - oh, and Ann was in the office as well. My main goal, however, was to get my hands on some coffee. Simple, right?

Now, there were some restrictions at play that limited my options. One norm in particular stood out: I wasn't allowed to go to Ann's office under any circumstances. That might seem weird, but it was a rule I had to follow.

So, given these beliefs and goals, as well as the restrictions, I started weighing my options. At first, I considered 'getShopCoffee' over 'getKitchenCoffee', all because of my priorities - quality, price, and time. You see, 'getShopCoffee' offered a quality score of 0.0, a price tag of 3.0, and a time cost of 9.0, while 'getKitchenCoffee' boasted a quality score of 5.0, a price of 0.0, and a time cost of just 3.0. Now, the decisive factor for me was quality - I wanted the best bang for my buck, so to speak. Since 'getShopCoffee' had a lower value than 'getKitchenCoffee', it seemed like the way to go.

But then, things got interesting. I realized that if I chose 'getAnnOfficeCoffee', I'd be forced to execute a prohibited action - going to Ann's office, remember? So, I had to veto that option altogether.

Fast-forwarding to my thought process again, I decided to perform 'getShopCoffee' since all its preconditions were met. You see, it relied on me having enough money, which I did. That set the stage for the next step: getting the coffee itself.

Of course, that meant I had to choose between 'getCoffee' and 'getShopCoffee'. As you can guess, I picked 'getCoffee', simply because it was a necessary step towards achieving my goal - getting coffee, remember?

Now, here's where things got really important. With my goal in mind, I chose 'getShopCoffee' as the next logical step. It seemed like the most efficient way to get what I wanted.

Finally, with all these steps leading up to it, I arrived at the moment of truth: 'payShop'. And guess what? Since I had enough money to spare, all its preconditions were met, so I was able to successfully perform that action too. It was a necessary step towards achieving my goal, after all.

There you have it - my thought process regarding 'payShop'!
