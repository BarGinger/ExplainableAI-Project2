Hey there! So, I wanted to walk you through my thought process when it comes to that action "payShop". Did I end up performing it? Well, let me tell you, it's not as straightforward as it seems. I mean, I had a bunch of initial beliefs to consider - like whether I had my staff card available or if payShop was even an option.

So, initially, I thought about getting my coffee through the regular channels. You know, just going to the shop and buying one like normal people do. But then I realized that I didn't have any cash on me, so that wasn't a viable option. And honestly, it was pretty convenient that payShop was an available option - it saved me from having to go all the way back home to grab some cash.

Now, when it came down to deciding between getting my coffee through payShop or just giving up and going without, I had to think about what would be best for me. See, one of my main goals was to get my coffee, and payShop seemed like the easiest way to achieve that. Plus, I wasn't really keen on wasting time going home and back again.

But, I also had some norms and restrictions to consider. Like, I knew that payShop was only available during certain hours, so if I waited too long, it would be closed already. And let's just say, I wasn't exactly thrilled about the idea of having to deal with crowds or lines at the shop. So, in a way, my norms and restrictions actually helped guide my decision-making.

Now, when it came down to choosing between payShop and giving up, I had to weigh the pros and cons. And honestly, for me, the convenience of payShop won out. I mean, why bother going all the way back home if I could just get my coffee right then and there? It was the easier option, and that's what I chose.

So, did I end up performing "payShop"? Yes, I did! And looking back, it seems like a pretty reasonable decision considering all the factors.
