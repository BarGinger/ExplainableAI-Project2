As I sit down to think about what to do next, I've got my beliefs and goals in mind. I believe that the staff card is available, which means I can use it if needed. Additionally, I have my own card, so I'm not relying solely on anyone else's help. My colleague is also available to assist me, and I have enough money to make any necessary purchases. To top it all off, Ann is in her office, which might come in handy later.

My main goal right now is to get some coffee – it's been a long day! I've got my priorities straight, too: quality, price, and time are my top considerations. If I can get a good deal on high-quality coffee that won't take up too much of my time, all the better!

As I start thinking about how to achieve this goal, I consider my options. One path might be to head to the kitchen to grab some coffee, but then I remember that there's also the possibility of getting it from the shop. I weigh the pros and cons of each option in my mind.

I decide against heading to the kitchen for now because, although it would take less time and cost me nothing, the quality isn't exactly top-notch. It's a decent backup plan, but I'm willing to invest some time and money if it means getting better coffee.

That leaves me with the shop as an option. At first glance, it seems like a good choice – it's quick and relatively cheap – but then I remember that there might be other options available. If Ann is in her office, maybe I can even get coffee from her, but alas, that's not allowed according to our norms: no going into her office!

In the end, I decide to go with getting coffee from the shop because it seems like my best bet for now. And, as it turns out, all the necessary preconditions are met – I have enough money – so I'm able to successfully complete that action.
