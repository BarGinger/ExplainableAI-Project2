Here's the rewritten explanation in first-person:

So, I was making decisions based on my beliefs, goals, and restrictions. One of the actions I considered taking was 'gotoKitchen', but before I got there, let me tell you what I believed at the time. I thought staffCardAvailable, ownCard, colleagueAvailable, and haveMoney were all true. My main goal was to haveCoffee - that's what drove my decision-making. Now, I know some actions are off-limits, and 'payShop' is one of them.

As I started thinking about how to achieve my goal, the first option that came up was to getKitchenCoffee. And you know what? It worked! The reason it did is because all the necessary preconditions - staffCardAvailable, in this case - were met. So, that's what I chose to do next.

Now, I also considered gettingAnnOfficeCoffee, but unfortunately, those conditions weren't satisfied. That was a dead end. When I thought about my other options, I realized that gettingShopCoffee wasn't on the table because it would have led me to perform an action I'm not supposed to take - payShop.

At this point, I knew I had to focus on the necessary steps to get my coffee. In my book, that means getting the coffee itself. So, that's what I chose to do next: getCoffee. It was a crucial step towards achieving my goal.

Of course, I didn't stop there. The next thing I did was getKitchenCoffee again. Why? Because it was another necessary step to get my coffee, and all the preconditions were met once more.

Before I got into the kitchen, though, I had to think about how to get my own card. Now, you might wonder why I prioritized getting my own card over someone else's. Well, let me tell you - it's because of my preferences. In order of importance, those are price, time, and quality. And when I looked at the options, I saw that my own card had a perfect score on all three: quality was 0.0, price was 0.0, and time was also 0.0. Meanwhile, someone else's card had a time value of 2.0 - not desirable at all! So, my choice was clear.

I successfully got my own card, which meant I was ready to take the next step: gotoKitchen. Now, this action is linked to getting my coffee in the kitchen, so it made sense to do them together.

That's the story of how I decided to 'gotoKitchen'.
