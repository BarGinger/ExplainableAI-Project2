Hey, so I've been trying to figure out what action to take next. Let me start by saying that I have some beliefs about the world - for instance, I think staff cards are available, I have my own card, my colleague is also around, and I've got the cash if needed.

My main goal right now is to get myself a cup of coffee. That's what drives most of my decisions, honestly.

Of course, there are some restrictions in place too. For instance, I'm not allowed to pay at the shop - it's one of those "payShop" norms that I've got to follow.

So, with all that in mind, let me walk you through how I decided on 'gotoKitchen'. To get started, I looked into whether I could grab some coffee from the kitchen. As it turns out, I was able to execute that action just fine - all the preconditions were met, and it seemed like a good way to get closer to my goal.

Now, you might wonder why I didn't consider getting coffee from Ann's office or even the shop itself. The thing is, those options wouldn't have worked out because they required certain conditions to be true (like Ann being in the office), which weren't met at the time. And as for the shop option, it would've led me down a path that included paying - something I wasn't allowed to do.

Instead, I decided to focus on getting my own card, since that seemed like a necessary step towards achieving my goal. It's funny, but when I weighed up the pros and cons of getting my own card versus someone else's, it was really the time factor that tipped the scales for me - getting my own card just seemed quicker in this case.

So, with my own card in hand, I looked into whether there were any other actions I could take to get closer to my goal. And that's when I realized that 'gotoKitchen' was actually a necessary step to achieve my ultimate goal of getting coffee from the kitchen. It all made sense once I took those smaller steps first.

Overall, it was just a matter of breaking down my goal into smaller, manageable chunks and making decisions based on what was available and what would get me closer to where I wanted to be. And that's how I ended up choosing 'gotoKitchen' in the end!
