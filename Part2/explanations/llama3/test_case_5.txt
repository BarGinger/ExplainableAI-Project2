Hey there! So, I want to tell you about this decision-making process I went through. It was quite the adventure, if I do say so myself.

So, the goal was to get some coffee, right? Well, I started by looking at my initial beliefs. Now, I knew that staff cards were available, and I had my own card too - it's always a good idea to have a backup plan! And, of course, my colleague was also available if I needed them.

As for norms and restrictions, there was this one rule: "payShop" is prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Now, that might seem strict, but trust me, it's for the best.

Now, let's talk about preferences. For me, quality, price, and time were all important factors in making my decisions. I mean, who doesn't love a good cup of coffee?

So, when it came to getting my coffee, I had a few options. I could get coffee from the kitchen, or go to the coffee shop, or even grab a card for one of my colleagues and let them take care of it.

At first, I was thinking about getting the coffee myself. But then I realized that going to the kitchen would be way more convenient - and who doesn't love a good shortcut? Plus, I knew that my staff card would work just fine there.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "What about the coffee shop?" Well, let me tell you, it was definitely an option. But then I remembered that paying for something unnecessarily is not exactly ideal - remember that norm? So, I decided to stick with the kitchen and get my coffee myself.

Of course, there were other options too. Like grabbing a card for one of my colleagues... but I knew they weren't available at the time. And going to the office wasn't really an option either - it would have taken way too long!

So, in the end, I decided to go with getting coffee from the kitchen using my own staff card. It was the most convenient and cost-effective option for me.

And that's how I got my coffee!
