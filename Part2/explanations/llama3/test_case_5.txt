Here's my attempt at rewriting your naive explanation into a natural, first-person account:

As I'm deciding what to do next, I start with the basics: I believe that my staff card is available, and so are my own card and colleague's. Plus, I have the means to make it happen - I have money. Now, my ultimate goal is to have some coffee, and I know exactly how I want to get there.

Now, when it comes to restrictions, I've got a simple rule: don't pay for something unless absolutely necessary. That's why I'm keenly aware of the prohibited actions that might pop up along the way.

So, let me walk you through my thought process. First, I considered getting some coffee from the kitchen. It seemed like a great option at first, but then I realized it was dependent on having my staff card available - which I did! So, I went ahead and got the kitchen coffee.

Next up, I looked into other options that might get me to my coffee goal. But, I quickly ruled out getting office coffee from Ann because she's not even in the office right now (I'm assuming that much!). And getting shop coffee wasn't an option either, since it would require me to pay - and I'm trying to avoid that.

At this point, I was left with a choice between my own card and someone else's. Now, I know what you're thinking: why not just grab someone else's? Well, for one thing, I'm trying to prioritize my preferences here. And when it comes down to it, getting my own card is the better option because it's cheaper (or should I say, lower cost!). Plus, it doesn't take any more time or sacrifice quality - so that was an easy choice.

With my own card in hand, I'm now ready to head into the kitchen and get some coffee. And guess what? It's a necessary step towards achieving my goal of having coffee! So, off I go to the kitchen, armed with my staff card and ready to get brewing.

That's my thought process in a nutshell - or rather, a cup of coffee!
