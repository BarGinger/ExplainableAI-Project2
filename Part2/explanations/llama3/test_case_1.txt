Here's a natural, first-person account of my decision-making process:

So, I was trying to decide what to do next. As far as I know, I have all the cards I need - literally! Both my own card and staff card are available, which is great. And let me tell you, having money is always a good thing. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure Ann is in the office today, so that's another plus.

My ultimate goal is to get some coffee, because, well, priorities. When it comes to getting my caffeine fix, I have three main considerations: quality, price, and time. To be honest, if I had to choose between a high-quality cup of coffee and one that's super affordable, I'd probably go with the cheaper option. But if it takes me forever to get there or costs an arm and a leg, then that's not ideal either.

Now, when it comes to restricted actions, there's only one thing on my mind: payShop. It's just not something I can do right now. So, considering all these factors, I decided to take the path of least resistance - or at least, the most promising option in terms of getting me that coffee.

I started by trying to get some coffee from the kitchen, and it looked like a good bet. Then, I figured it was worth checking if there's any staff card action available, just in case. After all, having that extra card might come in handy sometime. But ultimately, I decided not to waste my time getting other people's cards - I've got my own priorities!

So, I ended up going to the kitchen and trying to get some coffee from there. It was a pretty straightforward decision, if you ask me. And honestly, it looks like paying at the shop wasn't an option for me today. Maybe next time!
