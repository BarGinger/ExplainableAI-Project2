Here's a rewritten version of your naive explanation in first-person, with a natural tone:

So, let me explain why I decided to pay for that coffee. First, there were some things I knew going into this - like the fact that I had my own card and a staff card available, not to mention a colleague who was also around. And of course, I had enough money to splurge on a cuppa. Plus, Ann was in the office, which was a bonus.

My main goal was to get some coffee, and I was willing to do whatever it took to achieve that. Now, when it came to getting that coffee, I had certain priorities - price, time, and quality. In that order, mind you! So, with all these factors in play, I started thinking about my options.

As I weighed my choices, I decided to start by trying to get a cup of coffee from the kitchen. It seemed like the most straightforward option, especially since I was already there. But then I thought, why not try to get some staff card first? After all, it might come in handy later on. So, I took that route instead.

Long story short, I ended up getting a cup of coffee from the kitchen without needing any staff cards or anything else. And honestly, it was just what I needed - a quick and affordable brew that hit the spot. As for paying for it, well... considering my restrictions and goals, it wasn't an option I was willing to explore.

Of course, there were other routes I could have taken - like trying to get coffee from Ann's office or even the shop. But in the end, I stuck with what worked best for me: a straightforward, cost-effective solution that gave me exactly what I wanted.
