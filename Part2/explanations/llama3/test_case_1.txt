Hey there! So, I wanted to walk you through my thought process when it came to deciding whether or not to perform the action 'payShop'. You know how sometimes we have those little errands to run? Well, in this case, I was trying to figure out if I should stop by the shop and get some stuff.

First off, let me tell you that I started with a few beliefs - I thought staff cards were available, I had my own card, there was someone else around, and I had enough money. And, of course, I knew Ann was in the office. Those are all important things to keep in mind when making decisions.

Now, as for norms and restrictions, well, it turns out that 'payShop' is actually prohibited - so that ruled it out from the start! But don't worry, there were plenty of other options on the table.

In terms of goals, I was all about getting some coffee. That's what I really wanted to do, you know? And when it came to preferences, well, let's just say I prioritized price over time and quality. Makes sense, right?

Okay, so now that we've got those basics covered, let me walk you through my decision-making process. First, I considered all these different options for getting coffee - like getting it from the kitchen or going to the shop. And as it turned out, I ended up choosing the kitchen route.

Now, one of the reasons I went with that option was because I knew staff cards were available, and that made things a lot easier for me. Plus, having my own card meant I didn't have to worry about that either. So, all in all, it just seemed like a more convenient choice.

Of course, there were other options too - like getting coffee from Ann's office or the shop. But those wouldn't have been as practical given my initial beliefs and preferences. And let me tell you, not being able to 'payShop' because of that norm was definitely a consideration for me!

So, in the end, I decided to stick with the kitchen option - and it all worked out pretty smoothly. That's how I ended up with this path: getting coffee from the kitchen. No 'payShop' in sight!
