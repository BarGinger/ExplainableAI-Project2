Hey there! So, I wanted to walk you through my decision-making process for this task. You know how sometimes you gotta go shopping, right? Well, I was faced with a similar situation - I had to figure out the best way to get some coffee.

First off, let me tell you about my initial beliefs. I started with the assumption that the staff card was available, and I also had my own card handy. Plus, my colleague was around, and I knew I had enough money to spare. And, to top it all off, Ann was in the office - that's always a good sign!

Now, when it comes to norms and restrictions, there were a few things to keep in mind. For instance, I knew that paying at the shop was either prohibited or obligatory (depending on the situation), so that had to be factored in.

My goal, of course, was to get some coffee - it's always a top priority! And, as for preferences, I prioritized quality, price, and time. So, when I started looking into options, I considered a few different paths.

Initially, I thought about getting my own card or grabbing someone else's staff card. But then, I decided to head into the kitchen to see if I could find any coffee supplies lying around. It turned out that wasn't the case, so I moved on to other options.

Next up, I considered going to Ann's office or even popping into the shop itself. But, as it happened, paying at the shop just wasn't an option - or at least, not according to my initial beliefs!

As I kept exploring, I ran across a few different choices: get coffee from the kitchen, grab some stuff from the office, or maybe go shopping myself. But then, things got interesting.

I chose to get coffee from the kitchen, mainly because it seemed like the most straightforward option at the time. And hey, who doesn't love a good cup of joe? Plus, I figured it'd be faster and more cost-effective in the long run - after all, my preferences were all about quality, price, and time!

In the end, that's exactly what happened: I got some coffee from the kitchen, and everything worked out just fine. Of course, if things had gone differently, who knows? Maybe I would've ended up paying at the shop or grabbing coffee from Ann's office - but as it turned out, the kitchen was where my heart (and stomach) were!
