So, when it comes to making decisions, I've got certain beliefs that shape my actions. For instance, I believe my staff card is available, and so are my own card and colleague's card. I also think I have the necessary money and Ann is in the office, which is important for me.

My ultimate goal is to get a cup of coffee, no question about it. Now, when it comes to achieving this goal, I've got certain preferences that guide my choices. Time-wise, getting coffee isn't too high on my priority list – price and quality are more important to me, in that order.

So, considering all these factors, I started by evaluating my options. I chose a path that involved getting coffee from the kitchen, which seemed like a reasonable choice at the time. I figured it would be quick, easy, and maybe even a bit cost-effective. I didn't consider other options like paying for shop coffee or visiting Ann's office because they didn't seem as appealing given my current beliefs and goals.

As I explored this chosen path, I realized that getting staff card, own card, colleague's card, and going to the kitchen were all necessary steps to get my coffee. It was a straightforward process, and I eventually got my hands on some freshly brewed coffee – exactly what I needed!

Now, about that 'payShop' action – it wasn't something I considered in this particular scenario because it's restricted by certain norms. So, even if paying for shop coffee might have been the cheapest option, it just wasn't a viable choice given the rules and limitations I'm working with.

In hindsight, I made the right decision by choosing to get my coffee from the kitchen – it was the best option considering my beliefs, goals, and restrictions at the time.
