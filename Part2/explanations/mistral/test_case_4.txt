 Hi there! Let me walk you through how I made my decision to get the coffee. You see, I had two options - get the coffee from the kitchen or buy it at the shop. Here's why I chose to buy it from the shop instead of getting it from the kitchen.

First, let me tell you about the kitchen option. It was possible for me to get the coffee from the kitchen, as I had a staff card that would allow me access (P: staffCardAvailable). However, I couldn't choose this option because there wasn't any coffee in the kitchen at the moment (F: noCoffeeInKitchen).

Now, let me tell you about my choice - getting the coffee from the shop. This was possible for me since the shop was open and had coffee available (P: shopOpen, P: coffeeAvailableAtShop). I decided to get the coffee from the shop because it offered better quality than the kitchen coffee (V: buyCoffeeFromShop > getKitchenCoffee, where [betterQuality] is a cost factor for buyCoffeeFromShop and [lowerQuality] is a cost factor for getKitchenCoffee).

However, there was a norm that prevented me from buying the coffee directly - I wasn't allowed to pay for it without going through the proper payment process (N: payForCoffeeWithoutPaymentProcess). So, in order to comply with this norm, I had to go through the payment process before receiving my coffee (L: payShop -> payForCoffee).

Finally, let me explain why I went through all this trouble. You see, I wanted to get the best possible coffee for you (D: buyCoffeeFromShop), and I knew that buying it from the shop would give us a better cup of coffee than what was available in the kitchen at the moment (U: [quality] is an important factor for you).

I hope this helps you understand why I made the decision to get the coffee from the shop! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
