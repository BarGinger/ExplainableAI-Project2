 Hello there! Let me walk you through how I made my decisions.

   First, I wanted to get a coffee. But there were a few options available - I could get the kitchen coffee, ask Ann for office coffee, or go to the shop. The kitchen coffee was possible since I was already in the kitchen (P: in_kitchen). However, I don't have a staff card to access the office (F: no staff_card), so I couldn't ask Ann for office coffee. But you had given me a budget for today, and you mentioned that the shop coffee is more expensive than the kitchen coffee and office coffee (V: getShopCoffee > getKitchenCoffee, getOfficeCoffee).

   Now, I was wondering if I should go to the shop. But as I looked at my budget, I realized that buying coffee from the shop would mean paying for it (P: have_budget), which is against our rule of not spending money unnecessarily (N: payShop). So, I decided to stick with the kitchen coffee since it's both available and affordable (C: getKitchenCoffee).

   But here's the interesting part. Once I got the kitchen coffee, I realized that I needed a cup to drink it. The kitchen didn't have any cups at that moment. But luckily, there was a cup in the office! So, I went to the office (L: gotoOffice) and grabbed a cup from there (D: getCup).

   In summary, I made decisions based on what was possible, affordable, and efficient according to your preferences. I didn't want to spend too much money or go too far for a cup of coffee. And that's why I went to the kitchen first, then the office if necessary. I hope this helps you understand my thought process better!
