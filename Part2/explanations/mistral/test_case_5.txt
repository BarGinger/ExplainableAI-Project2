 To achieve our goal of having coffee, let's walk through the thought process of our agent. The agent was tasked with the goal of obtaining coffee and had some initial beliefs, such as having both a staff card and their own card, a colleague being available, and possessing money. However, there were certain restrictions, or norms, that the agent had to adhere to, in this case, not paying at the shop.

   The agent first considered various options systematically to get coffee. It evaluated 'getKitchenCoffee' because it could use either a staff card (which was available) or a colleague's card (since a colleague was available but not used in this case). Unfortunately, getting Ann's office coffee wasn't an option as she wasn't currently in her office.

   The agent then considered going to the shop, which would lead to paying, a prohibited action due to the norm. Instead, the agent decided to get its own card because it knew this would help achieve the goal more efficiently based on the user's preferences for price, time, and quality. Since the agent already possessed its own card, it was able to obtain it.

   With its own card in hand, the agent was now ready to go to the kitchen (as 'gotoKitchen' is linked or dependent on 'getCoffeeKitchen'). The goal-directed action of going to the kitchen enabled the agent to get coffee from the kitchen.

   Throughout this process, user preferences influenced certain decisions. For instance, the agent chose to get its own card over another person's card (if available) due to the preference for lower prices and shorter time. It also prioritized options that met these criteria when evaluating the various coffee-getting methods.

   In summary, our agent systematically evaluated each option in pursuit of its goal: getting coffee. By leveraging its initial beliefs, adhering to norms, and prioritizing user preferences, it successfully chose to go to the kitchen to obtain the desired coffee without paying at the shop.
