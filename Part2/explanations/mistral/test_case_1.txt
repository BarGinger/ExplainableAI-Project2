 In our story, the main goal is to enjoy a cup of coffee. To accomplish this, we have several actions available, but there are some constraints and preferences to consider. The most important considerations are price, time, and quality in that order. However, there's also a restriction: I cannot pay at the shop (P(payShop)).

Initially, I began by considering getting coffee either from the kitchen or the cafeteria (getCoffee, getKitchenCoffee). As I am allowed to access the kitchen and have my own card, I decided to get coffee from there. But before that, since there's a staff member available with a staff card, I could potentially use their card as well. However, I have my own card, so I opted to use it instead (getStaffCard rejected, getOwnCard chosen).

Next, I moved towards the kitchen to fetch the coffee (gotoKitchen). Once in the kitchen, I found that I can either get a cup of coffee or make myself some using the coffee maker. Given that my goal is to have coffee as soon as possible, I decided to grab one already made (getCoffeeKitchen).

At this point, I realized that I could potentially get coffee from Ann's office too if she was there (getAnnOfficeCoffee). Since she was indeed in her office, I considered going to her office to get the coffee. However, instead of that detour, I decided to return to my original plan of using the kitchen coffee (gotoKitchen rejected, getAnnOfficeCoffee ignored).

From here, things got a bit complicated. As I couldn't pay at the shop due to the restriction, I had to look for other ways to obtain coffee from outside the office (getShopCoffee). To do this, I could either go to the shop or ask a colleague for their card if they happen to have one (getOthersCard). But as there were no such options available and I already had my own card, I decided to stick with getting coffee from the kitchen.

As you might have guessed by now, the final decision point was whether to pay at the shop or not (payShop). Since this action is restricted, it could not be executed (payShop rejected). Instead, I chose to enjoy my coffee from the kitchen as planned (getCoffeeKitchen).

In summary, due to the restriction on paying at the shop and the need to prioritize time, price, and quality, I decided to get coffee from the kitchen using my own card. This way, I was able to achieve my goal of having coffee while adhering to the given constraints and preferences.
