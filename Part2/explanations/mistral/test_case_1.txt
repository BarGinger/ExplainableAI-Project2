 In our scenario, we have an intelligent agent with the goal of obtaining coffee. It's important to note that there are certain restrictions (norms) in place, such as not being able to use the 'payShop' action. The agent has some initial beliefs about its resources and environment, like having a staff card, own card, a colleague available, money on hand, and knowing that Ann is currently in the office.

   To start with, our agent first considers getting coffee from either the kitchen or the coffee machine in the office (getCoffee, getKitchenCoffee). Since it doesn't have a staff card yet, it decides to attempt getting one using its own card or asking a colleague for theirs. This series of actions leads to 'getStaffCard', 'getOwnCard', and 'getOthersCard'. However, as the agent does not possess another colleague's card, it moves on to other options.

   Next, the agent evaluates whether going directly to the kitchen (gotoKitchen) would yield better results than trying to obtain coffee from Ann's office (gotoAnnOffice). Given that Ann is in her office and the agent has no pod to access coffee there (getPod), it decides to go to the kitchen. After arriving at the kitchen, it finds out that it can either get coffee from the kitchen coffee machine or ask Ann for some (getCoffeeKitchen, getAnnOfficeCoffee).

   Now, our agent faces a dilemma. It wants coffee, but it knows it can't use the 'payShop' action due to the norm restricting its usage. Instead, it opts to choose the most cost-effective and time-efficient path possible, given its preferences for price, time, and quality. The choice of getting coffee from the kitchen (getCoffeeKitchen) over asking Ann for some coffee or going to a shop aligns with these preferences since it's likely to be both quicker and cheaper than other alternatives.

   In summary, our agent systematically evaluated each available option based on its goal, resources, environment, and user preferences to finally decide on getting coffee from the kitchen, bypassing the 'payShop' action due to the norm restriction in place. Its decisions were goal-directed (D codes), influenced by preconditions (P codes like staffCardAvailable, ownCard, haveMoney), conditions that allowed choices (C codes like AnnInOffice), and its user preferences for price, time, and quality (U codes).
