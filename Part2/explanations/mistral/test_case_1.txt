 Hi there! Let me explain how I decided to get coffee for you. You mentioned that you prefer coffee with good quality, reasonable price, and quick service. My goal was to find a way to get coffee that aligned with your preferences.

   First, I considered getting coffee from the kitchen using the staff card since it was available at that moment. However, as I wanted to ensure high-quality coffee, I decided against this option because the quality of the coffee in the kitchen might not be as good as other options. This is an example of a failed condition ('F').

   Next, I thought about getting coffee from the kitchen without using the staff card, but I realized that would require me to have a card of my own which I currently don't possess. So, I got my own card to make this option possible.

   Then, I considered getting coffee from the kitchen again since it was close by and would save time. However, in this case, I chose to get coffee from the kitchen itself ('C') because the staff card was available, which allowed me to get better quality coffee compared to the other options at that moment. This decision was also influenced by your preference for quick service.

   After getting the coffee from the kitchen, I realized I still had the opportunity to use a staff card or my own card to get coffee from the shop if needed. However, since I had already fulfilled the goal of getting coffee for you using the available options, I decided not to proceed with this possibility as it would involve an unnecessary step ('N', 'getShopCoffee', 'P(payShop)').

   In summary, I first checked the kitchen for a staff card and found one, which led me to get coffee from the kitchen. This was the best choice given your preferences for quality, price, and time. I hope you enjoy your coffee!
