 Hi there! You asked me to get some coffee for you, and since you value quality, price, and time in that order, I wanted to make sure I find the perfect blend. Let's go through my decision-making process step by step.

First things first, I knew that there was a coffee machine in the kitchen (getKitchenCoffee), and another one in Ann's office (getAnnOfficeCoffee). However, since you didn't specify which office Ann is currently at, I couldn't be certain if I could get coffee there right away (L code: dependent actions).

Next, I thought about using the staff card to get coffee from the machine in the kitchen (getStaffCard) or using my own card (getOwnCard), as both cards have access to the coffee machines. But since you're on a budget and I wanted to prioritize cost, I decided to use my own card instead (P code: conditions that made an action possible).

After securing the card, I headed towards the kitchen to get some coffee (gotoKitchen). Upon arriving, I found freshly brewed coffee waiting for me in the coffee machine (getCoffeeKitchen). Since it was already prepared and ready to go, I served you the coffee without any delay (D code: actions that helped achieve the goal), keeping your preference for a quick service in mind.

Now, here's where things got tricky. While looking for a way to pay for goods at the shop using my own card, I encountered a restriction (N code: norms preventing certain actions). The restriction was that I cannot use my card for shopping purposes (type: P, actions: ['payShop']).

So, I had to come up with another solution. Since Ann was in the office and I knew she often buys coffee from the shop (AnnInOffice), I asked her if I could borrow some money to pay for the coffee (getAnnOfficeCoffee, gotoAnnOffice). She gladly obliged, and I went to the shop to get you a fresh cup of coffee (gotoShop, payShop, getCoffeeShop) with the change she gave me.

In the end, I managed to find the perfect blend that suited your preferences for quality, price, and time while overcoming a restriction and making the most out of the available resources. Enjoy your coffee!
