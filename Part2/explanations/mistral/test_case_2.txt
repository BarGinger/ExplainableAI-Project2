**Scenario Name:** Morning Coffee Routine

I performed 'getCoffeeKitchen' in the Morning Coffee Routine. Here's why.

**Path Taken:**
To achieve my goal, I followed this approach: get my own card, go to the kitchen, and then get coffee from the kitchen.

**Context:**
In this scenario, my initial beliefs were that staff cards are available and I have my own card. The goal was for me to have coffee, with preferences for quality, price, and time in descending order of importance. As a user, you value having your coffee quickly without compromising on its taste and affordability.

**Reasoning:**
I considered different ways to reach my goal. Initially, I thought about getting coffee from the office or shop, but these options were not viable due to the preconditions that weren't met (staff card availability for the office and having money for the shop).

However, I realized that having my own card would allow me to access the kitchen, where I could get high-quality coffee quickly. This path was more efficient and aligned with your preferences.

I chose to perform 'getCoffeeKitchen' because it offered a better compromise between quality, price, and time. By getting my own card and then going to the kitchen, I ensured that I would have access to good-tasting coffee without overspending or wasting too much time.

That's why I performed 'getCoffeeKitchen'.
