 In our scenario, the AI was tasked with getting coffee for itself, considering quality, price, and time as its preferences. It didn't have any restrictions (or norms) regarding this action. Initially, it had two beliefs: it knew it had a staff card and that it also possessed an own card.

   To start, the AI considered multiple paths to achieve its goal of having coffee. It first thought about getting kitchen coffee because it was aware that it had the necessary staff card. However, there were other options it looked into as well. One of them was getting coffee from Ann's office, but it couldn't do this since Ann wasn't currently in her office at the moment. Another option was purchasing coffee from a shop, but it didn't have enough money at that time.

   The AI then decided to focus on getting the actual coffee by first choosing the path of getting kitchen coffee again, since it had the staff card available and this seemed like a viable option. It then realized it needed both a staff card and its own card in order to get kitchen coffee. So, it proceeded to get its own card as it was already in possession of one.

   Next, it tried to get coffee from colleagues but couldn't since they were not available at the moment. At this point, it realized that it needed to either obtain a staff card from someone else or go to the kitchen using its own card. Since going to the kitchen was necessary for both options, the AI decided to first move towards the kitchen, ensuring it had its own card with it.

   Upon reaching the kitchen, it attempted to get coffee again, but this time with its own card. This action (getCoffeeKitchen) was successful since it had both the necessary items: a card and was physically present at the kitchen.

   In summary, the AI's decision-making process can be broken down into several steps:
   1. Identify multiple paths to achieve its goal of getting coffee
   2. Evaluate each path systematically based on preconditions and preferences
   3. Choose the path with the least obstacles, in this case getting kitchen coffee with a staff card
   4. Gather any missing resources required for the chosen path (in this case, its own card)
   5. Proceed to execute the chosen action (getCoffeeKitchen), which was successful.
