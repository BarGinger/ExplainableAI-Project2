 Hi there! You've asked me to explain my thought process behind getting you a coffee. Let me take you through it step by step.

First and foremost, I understood that you wanted a cup of coffee, specifically one with good quality, reasonable price, and served quickly. I kept these preferences in mind as I explored the available options.

Initially, I considered getting coffee from the kitchen. To do this, I needed to have either a staff card or my own card. Luckily, I had both. So, I first got my own card to ensure that I could use it if necessary.

Next, I attempted to get the kitchen coffee. However, having a card wasn't enough; I also needed to be at the kitchen, which wasn't my current location. So, I moved to the kitchen. Once there, I was finally able to get the kitchen coffee.

At this point, I had considered other options like getting coffee from the Annex Office or the Shop. However, neither of these places were feasible at that moment. The Annex Office coffee wasn't accessible because you weren't in your office, and the Shop coffee was out of reach since I didn't have enough money on hand.

In summary, to get you a coffee as quickly as possible, I chose to get it from the kitchen because I could use my own card, move to the kitchen, and then grab the coffee with ease. I hope this explanation helps clarify my decision-making process! Now, let's enjoy your freshly brewed coffee together!
