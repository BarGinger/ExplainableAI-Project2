**Action to Explain:** getCoffeeShop
**Was it part of the selected path?**: Yes

I performed 'getCoffeeShop' in the "Coffee Run" scenario. Here's why.

**Path Taken:**
To achieve my goal, I followed this approach: getKitchenCoffee -> couldn't execute because of staffCardAvailable not met; chose getShopCoffee over getAnnOfficeCoffee based on user's preferences to prioritize quality, price, and time; then gotShopCoffee was performed; next, I paidShop and finally achieved the goal with getCoffeeShop.

**Context:**
I knew that Ann was in the office, and I had money. My initial goal was to have a coffee. The user's preferences were to prioritize quality, price, and time. Actions I performed included getting coffee from various places like my kitchen, staff card, or others' card, visiting those places, paying for the coffee, and eventually going to the shop.

**Reasoning:**
I considered different ways to reach my goal. I chose 'getCoffeeShop' because it was a necessary step to achieve the goal action and offered a quality coffee at an affordable price within a reasonable time frame. Although there were alternative options like getting coffee from Ann's office or others' card, they were less effective due to the constraints of not having the necessary staff card or card available.

That's why I performed 'getCoffeeShop'.
